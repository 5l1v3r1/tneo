The library file tneokernel_cortex_m4_keil5.lib is compiled for Cortex-M4
without FPU by library project:

%tneokernel_path%/src/arch/cortex_m/keil5_uvision/tneokernel_cortex_m_keil5.uvprojx

If you need another target, you should compile it yourself: in project
properties, go to tab Device, and select needed platform (Cortex-M3, etc)
