[[thoughts]]



== Routine ==

   * [ ] Exchange object
   * [ ] probably move _tn_memcpy_uword() to something like `tn_util.c`
   * [ ] rename tn_callback_... to _tn_cb_....


=== profiler ===

   * [ ] document profiler functionality in arch-dependent functions
   * [ ] profiler for all platforms
   * [ ] document things
   * [ ] system service for getting profiler information
   * [ ] add TN_ON_SWITCH_CONTEXT_HANDLER_PRESENT, which should reflect TN_STACK_OVERFLOW_CHECK as well (in the future).
   * [ ] refactor profiler structure names
   * [ ] add service to set task name

=== dynamic tick ===

   * [ ] make TN_DYNAMIC_TICK off by default
   * [ ] round_robin if TN_DYNAMIC_TICK is on


=== PIC24/dsPIC port ===

   * [X] tn_arch_sr_restore: restore only IPL field
   * [X] TN_IS_INT_DISABLED() : implement
   * [X] handle IFS1 atomically (__tn_arch_context_switch_pend, __INT1Interrupt)
   * [X] SPLIM
   * [X] Rewrite context switch routine (__INT0Interrupt)
   * [X] ffs

=== Cortex-M port ===

   * [X] document building: all include directories, C99, Asm --cpreproc, etc
   * [X] preprocess .S file
   * [X] make .S file work with GCC, too
   * [X] don't include cmsis by the core; use hardcoded addresses instead. It should work for all cortex-m devices.
   * [X] FPU support
   * [X] cortex m0 support
   * [X] manage PSP correctly (now, first context switch works, but the next one doesn't)
   * [X] use interrupt_stack

=== exchange methods ===

   * tn_exch_create
   * tn_exch_delete
   * tn_exch_link_add
   * tn_exch_link_remove
   * 
   * tn_read
   * tn_write
   * tn_iwrite
   * 
   * tn_lock
   * tn_unlock
   * tn_unlock_and_notify
   * tn_iunlock_and_notify

== Plans ==

   * [ ] Exchange object: see AVIX User Guide & Reference Guide, 6.6.8
   * [ ] Event group: probably, add mask of flags that should be cleared automatically when any task `wait`s for it
   * [ ] Add a destroy callback for each task, this callback (if not NULL) should be called whenever task is terminated with `tn_task_exit()` or `tn_task_terminate()`.
   * [o] Examples
      * [X] Separate platform-dependent code from the real example project code
      * [ ] Provide examples for all common system services: timers, queues, etc.
   * [ ] Port to ARM
   * [ ] Test how much is it slower to use tn_arch_sr_save_int_dis()/tn_arch_sr_restore() instead of TN_INT_DIS_SAVE()/TN_INT_RESTORE()
   * [ ] Optionally, check if stack pointer is overflowed on each context switch.
