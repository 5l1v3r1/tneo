== Routine ==


== Plans ==

   * [ ] Timer object
   * [ ] Event group connection (at least, it would be useful to connect event group to queue)
   * [ ] Add a destroy callback for each task, this callback (if not NULL) should be called whenever task is terminated with `tn_task_exit()` or `tn_task_terminate()`.
