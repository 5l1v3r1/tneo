== Routine ==

   * [o] Timer
      * [X] tn_timer_start() should allow re-starting timer (that is, start timer again if it is already active)
      * [X] what if we manage timers from the function called by timer? The tn_timer_list is altered, so, things may be mixed up
      * [ ] probably we should add flags like SINGLE_SHOT and CYCLIC.
      * [ ] write 'detailed description' in the tn_timer.h
      * [X] probably move definition of tn_timer_list__gen and tn_timer_list__tick to the `tn_timer.c`, add `_tn_timers_init()`. So that all the timer-related stuff is in the single file.

== Plans ==

   * [ ] Timer object
   * [ ] Event group connection (at least, it would be useful to connect event group to queue)
   * [ ] Event group: probably, add mask of flags that should be cleared automatically when any task `wait`s for it
   * [ ] Add a destroy callback for each task, this callback (if not NULL) should be called whenever task is terminated with `tn_task_exit()` or `tn_task_terminate()`.
   * [ ] Examples
      * [ ] Separate platform-dependent code from the real example project code
      * [ ] Provide examples for all common system services: timers, queues, etc.
   * [ ] Port to ARM
   * [ ] Probably port to PIC24/dsPIC
