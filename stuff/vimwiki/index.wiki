== Routine ==


== Plans ==

   * [ ] Event group connection (at least, it would be useful to connect event group to queue)
   * [ ] Exchange object: see AVIX User Guide & Reference Guide, 6.6.8
   * [ ] Event group: probably, add mask of flags that should be cleared automatically when any task `wait`s for it
   * [ ] Add a destroy callback for each task, this callback (if not NULL) should be called whenever task is terminated with `tn_task_exit()` or `tn_task_terminate()`.
   * [ ] Examples
      * [ ] Separate platform-dependent code from the real example project code
      * [ ] Provide examples for all common system services: timers, queues, etc.
   * [ ] Port to ARM
   * [ ] Probably port to PIC24/dsPIC
   * [ ] Test how much is it slower to use tn_arch_sr_save_int_dis()/tn_arch_sr_restore() instead of TN_INT_DIS_SAVE()/TN_INT_RESTORE()
