/**
 * Create task.
 *
 * This function creates a task. A field id_task of the structure task must be set to 0 before invoking this
 * function. A memory for the task TCB and a task stack must be allocated before the function call. An
 * allocation may be static (global variables of the struct TN_Task type for the task and
 * unsigned int [task_stack_size] for the task stack) or dynamic, if the user application supports
 * malloc/alloc (TNKernel itself does not use dynamic memory allocation).
 * The task_stack_size value must to be chosen big enough to fit the task_func local variables and its switch
 * context (processor registers, stack and instruction pointers, etc.).
 * The task stack must to be created as an array of unsigned int. Actually, the size of stack array element
 * must be identical to the processor register size (for most 32-bits and 16-bits processors a register size
 * equals sizeof(int)).
 * A parameter task_stack_start must point to the stack bottom. For instance, if the processor stack grows
 * from the high to the low memory addresses and the task stack array is defined as
 * unsigned int xxx_xxx[task_stack_size] (in C-language notation),
 * then the task_stack_start parameter has to be &xxx_xxx[task_stack_size - 1].
 *
 * @param task       Ready-allocated struct TN_Task structure. A field id_task of it must be 
 *                   set to 0 before invocation of tn_task_create().
 * @param task_func  Task body function.
 * @param priority   Priority for new task. NOTE: the lower value, the higher priority.
 *                   Must be > 0 and < (TN_NUM_PRIORITY - 1).
 * @param task_stack_start    Task start pointer.
 *                            A task must be created as an array of int. Actually, the size
 *                            of stack array element must be identical to the processor 
 *                            register size (for most 32-bits and 16-bits processors
 *                            a register size equals sizeof(int)).
 *                            NOTE: See option TN_API_TASK_CREATE for further details.
 * @param task_stack_size     Size of task stack
 *                            (actually, size of array that is used for task_stack_start).
 * @param            Parameter that is passed to task_func.
 * @option           (0): task is created in DORMANT state,
 *                        you need to call tn_task_activate() after task creation.
 *                   (TN_TASK_START_ON_CREATION): task is created and activated.
 *
