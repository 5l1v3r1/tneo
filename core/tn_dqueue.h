/**

 *
 * A data queue is a FIFO that stores pointer (of type void*) in each cell,
 * called (in Î¼ITRON style) a data element. A data queue also has an associated
 * wait queue each for sending (wait_send queue) and for receiving
 * (wait_receive queue).  A task that sends a data element is tried to put the
 * data element into the FIFO. If there is no space left in the FIFO, the task
 * is switched to the WAITING state and placed in the data queue's wait_send
 * queue until space appears (another task gets a data element from the data
 * queue).  A task that receives a data element tries to get a data element
 * from the FIFO. If the FIFO is empty (there is no data in the data queue),
 * the task is switched to the WAITING state and placed in the data queue's
 * wait_receive queue until data element arrive (another task puts some data
 * element into the data queue).  To use a data queue just for the synchronous
 * message passing, set size of the FIFO to 0.  The data element to be sent and
 * received can be interpreted as a pointer or an integer and may have value 0
 * (NULL).
